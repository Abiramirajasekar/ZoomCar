            <h3><b>SELF DRIVE CARS IN PUNE</b> </h3>
            <p>The cultural capital of Maharashtra, Pune was once home to the mighty Marathas, and retains their legacy
                in the many monuments it is home to, as well as the rich culture which is lovingly preserved by the
                people of the city. Pune is called the Oxford of the East and is fast emerging as the preferred
                destination for several multinational companies too. With opportunities for education, jobs and a
                vibrant nightlife, Pune attracts youngsters from all over the country.
                These money-savvy youngsters seek the convenience of self-drive cars without the liability of buying and
                owning one. Zoomcar fills this need with a well-maintained fleet of cars from every segment. Choose a
                Zoomcar self-drive car rental in Pune and experience the convenience it provides.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>SELF DRIVE CAR ON RENT IN PUNE</h3>
            <p>Besides a range of cars to choose from, Zoomcar also offers its users a choice of flexible tariff plans.
                Pick a plan keeping in mind your requirement to make the most of every booking. If you are looking for a
                vehicle to commute to work or college, the Zoom commute is the right plan for you. Travel alone, or
                carpool with your friends, sharing the cost of rental for maximum savings. Pune is central to several
                tourist destinations, the most popular among which are Lonavla and Khandala. Make every weekend fun with
                a self-drive car rental to a new destination. Zoomcar not only ensures freedom safety and privacy but
                also comes with features which are designed to ensure a hassle free ride. </p>

        <div>
            <h3>CAR RENTAL IN PUNE</h3>
            <p>For frequent travelers shuttling between Pune to Mumbai on a regular basis, taking a car for rent in Pune
                is ideal as they have the convenience of embarking on the journey at any time of the day. The well
                maintained Mumbai-Pune expressway is a pleasure to drive on. For those visiting the temple town of
                Shirdi from Pune, a rental car would be more reasonable and convenient when compared to a chauffeur
                driven car as the queues at the temples are unpredictable. It is a 4-hour drive from Pune to Shirdi.</p>
        </div>
